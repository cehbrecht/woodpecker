# Woodpecker

Woodpecker is a lightweight, code-driven fix catalog for climate datasets.

- **Fix codes** are stable identifiers (e.g. `CMIP6D01`) that external systems (like an ESGF errata UI) can reference.
- The catalog can be exported as **Markdown** (`FIXES.md`) and **JSON** (`FIXES.json`), and rendered as a small interactive web page (`fixes.html`).
